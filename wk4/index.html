<h1>One-Pager: Nol-Bu Korean Restaurant</h1>

<h2>Short Pitch</h2> 

<p>nolbu.com is a business website for my parent's Korean restaurant.</p>

<h2>Long Pitch</h2>

<p>nolbu.com will be designed to be a online presence for my parent's Korean restaurant, Nolbu. The food served are traditional and homely meals and the site would reflect that in style and design. The website will give an overview of the restaurant establishment, the menu offerings, location, contact information, and other tidbits such as the biography of the employees to share the restaurant's culture, beliefs, and personalities. Currently, the restaurant only has a yelp page and I am interested in creating an official website to promote the restaurant using photos of the food as well as the experience one may discover when they visit Nolbu. The site will also display social media and reviews to give visitors a chance to share their own experiences as well as read about other's experiences.</p>

<h3>Amy the Experiencer</h3>

<p>As a frequent traveller, there is not a place on Earth Amy has not been to. She absolutely loves Asian culture and cuisine. She has many friends, however they are unable to share the same experiences with Amy, so she usually invites her friends to go to ethnic restaurants</p>

<h3>Jim the Price Conscious</h3>

<p>Always busy at the office, Jim does not have time to brown bag his lunch. He opts for local restaurants, but is always looking for the best deals. Since he always eats out, he leaves many reviews on social media sites, such as Facebook or Yelp!.</p>
    
<h3>Carol the Health Nut</h3>

<p>Religious to health and fitness, Carol has read about the benefits of eating Korean food. Traditional dishes such as kimchi and ginseng are considered to be super foods and are packed with micronutrients. Carol can't get enough!
