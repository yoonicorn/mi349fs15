nolbu.com will be designed to be a online presence for my parent's Korean restaurant, Nolbu. The website will give an overview of the restaurant establishment, the menu offerings, location, contact information, and other tidbits such as the biography of the employees to share the restaurant's culture, beliefs, and personalities. Currently, the restaurant only has a yelp page and I am interested in creating an official website to promote the restaurant using photos of the food as well as the experience one may discover when they visit Nolbu. The site will also display social media and reviews to give visitors a chance to share their own experiences as well as read about other's experiences.
